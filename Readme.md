# Initial Coarse Alignment

This code is used to achieve the coarse initial attitude before the navigation. The realization of this code refer the paper "A High-Accuracy GPS-Aided Coarse Alignment Method for MEMS-Based SINS". The code is reproduced by myself and does not verified by the author of the reference.
